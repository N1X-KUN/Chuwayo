how can i make these gif/ png/ zip characters that i found: https://trickcalviewer.pages.dev as characters that i will make... and the assets or map will be found in itch.io... can you instruct and give me detailed guides to how to do this plan of mine? its design or system method is similar or as identical to the game bilibili Trickcal:Chibi Go-Trickcal or Treat game in mobile, it landscape format, art, theme, vibe basically everything aside from the gacha system or complex character relics or leveling system aside, but the gameplay or game mechanic is completely different as its a speed typing game as referenced from "https://youtu.be/HvMrOoUeqO0?si=qfS1bRMyo9UKsEv8" or "https://youtu.be/j98a_X9G1fM?si=fn7MNxbvFxHuXKtD" below is the detailed ideas and procedure i want to be done currently the details and draft/template idea for now:


heres my idea: I want to make a 2d unity game that is revolving around https://trickcal.com, same ui, game game atmosphere, layout and game design but the mechanics and level system a bit changed... this is the game mechanics i want it to have or referenced from: https://zty.pe/ so the characters and enemies are taken from trickcal universe/assets but the game mechanics is following https://zty.pe/.

so there will be a title screen, loading screen, level ui design, ALL SIMILAR to the app game Trickcal:Chibi Go-Trickcal or Treat, the theme, atmosphere, design, but the only thing that changed is the gameplay and story is quite like this web game "speed typing" https://zty.pe/ and the story is basically something like A mischievous entity known as the "Mute Phantom" has cast a spell over the Trickcal universe, erasing the "True Names" of all food. Without their names, the food is turning into Gray Dust. As the Commander, you must type the names of falling fruits and vegetables to "restore their existence" before they hit the ground. If they fall into the Phantom’s bag, the characters go hungry, and the void consumes the world!

Game idea: basically each level (there will be a tutorial level to teach how it works) is themed of one food genre like level 1 is fruits themed meaning all the words falling down are words of apple or banana then level 2 are all vegetables like carrots, etc. The character will be taken from https://trickcalviewer.pages.dev and the game will be landscape just as similar from the image attached, there will be shop to buy different characters, each characters has their own special ability like slow fall which makes the food fall slower to give the user more time to type out all the words... the menu bar has Settings - Play - Shop - Lobby - Credit


Play - is basically the level world map, level 1 is only available and the next level will be locked until the previews level is completed, there's 2 maps, in the first 5 levels will be in City Map, the next 5 will be in Outskirts Map, each level progressively gets more difficult and more reliant to the power ups and speed typing.

Settings - Controls the music volume and sfx of the game (these are separate controls), redeem code (where if the user specifically types "CreativeIncubator" they are rewarded with instant 100 Coins to buy stuff in the shop, is this function possible?)

Lobby - Where the user can pre select which character he/she wants to use or equip and as well view the other unclaimed characters to be grinded for in the shop, here they can also spend coins to level up their character to unlock each characters special ability to aid them in the levels. The user can drag, drop, touch or tickle them similar in trickal, so there should be hitmarkers like if touched in the stomach they switch their idle animation to laughing animation then when not touched in their stomach they revert back to their default idle animation, same applies to being dragged or tap on the head and being fed, in the lobby the foods the user collect can be used to feed their characters and make them happier, and build stronger bond.

Shop - The user may purchase the characters that are currently in the game, the user uses coins as currency ingame to buy characters and even cosmetics (different skins for the character) and theirs the daily random shop where it sells characters special ability for half price but its random. The user can also find the "TOP UP" feature where the user actually pays money to add on more ingame coins to buy more stuff without the need of grinding the game for extra coins.

Credits - Well as the name says its a credit it shows the team members picture and the roles they have contributed in making the game

basically thats the general main menu plan ideas... 

so where do we begin? make the game mechanics first? I have uploaded the sprites i want to turn into characters in the assets folder inside a sub folder named as character sprites, just create a md instruction for me to follow as i have forgotten how to use unity here.
